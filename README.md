# What's the purpose of this platform?

This platform tackles the problem of mismatched leads. 

### **Businesses struggling with irrelevant leads can sell them to companies better suited to fulfill them.**

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/695e28c1-b6c1-4d04-9026-daab376c7136/554825fa-cad9-4107-9396-235518844853/Untitled.png)

Everyone wins: sellers get cash, buyers get new leads, and customers get the right service.

**The vision** 

- Creating a win win situation where all businesses benefit, reduce costs and get more jobs.
- Keeping more money in the pockets of local businesses that would otherwise be spent with the big advertising platforms.
- Help accelerate growth and job opportunities to lead buyers.
- Have sellers and buyers on the platform that have a good reputation and track record.


# Who is this platform for?

- Are you a business that receives quality leads but struggles to fulfill them?
- Want to turn those unused leads into profits instead of letting them go to waste?
- Looking for more work and leads that align with your expertise?
- Tired of spending a fortune on major advertising platforms only to get irrelevant or costly leads?

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/695e28c1-b6c1-4d04-9026-daab376c7136/545b9480-9d06-4aab-a68c-2945746179d3/Untitled.png)

Our platform is here to help. We connect businesses like yours with others that can meet those valuable leads, turning your unused leads into revenue. Say goodbye to wasted opportunities and hello to a steady stream of relevant leads at affordable rates.

**Example 1: Automotive locksmiths** 

When a residential locksmith company receives a request to duplicate car keys, a service they don't provide, they can sell this lead to an automotive locksmith through our platform. 

**Example 2: Air conditioning cleaning**

Companies providing air conditioning repair services often receive inquiries about air conditioning cleaning, a service they may not always offer. By leveraging this platform, they can seamlessly sell these leads to air conditioning cleaners in their area.

**Example 3: Vending machine orders**

A vending machine company typically requires a minimum order of 10 machines. However, around 70% of their incoming leads request only 1-3 machines. Through our platform, they can efficiently sell these surplus leads to other vending machine companies in their area, creating a win-win situation where these companies can fulfill smaller orders that suit their capacity and customers' needs.”


# Who are the “sellers” and “buyers”?

### **Sellers:**

Sellers are businesses that receive valuable leads but lack the capacity or resources to provide the required services. These businesses, spanning various industries and sizes, benefit from the platform by efficiently redirecting these leads to suitable service providers. 

**Benefits for Sellers:**

- **Turn leads into profit:** Sellers can direct their leads to other businesses and make instant profit.
- **Solution for irrelevant leads:** When receiving an enquiry that their business can't fulfill, sellers can convert them into extra revenue instead of throwing them away.
- **Improved customer satisfaction:** By ensuring their leads are serviced, sellers can provide a solution for their customers, enhancing satisfaction and loyalty.

---

### **Buyers:**

Buyers are businesses equipped to serve the leads generated by sellers on the platform. Ranging from individual professionals to established companies, these buyers gain access to a steady stream of quality leads.

**Benefits for Buyers:**

- **Access to more quality leads:** Buyers gain access to a new and unique stream of quality leads that are already interested in services, increasing sales opportunities.
- **Affordable leads:** These qualified leads will typically cost less than other sources of paid advertising (google ads, facebook ads etc).
- **Know what you get:** Buyers can set the rules for the leads they want by service, location etc.

**An example seller / buyer scenario (Win-Win for locksmiths)**

**Seller:**
Luke owns "Metro Locksmith" in Melbourne, getting 15-20 leads daily through Google ads. About 2-5 of these leads are for automotive locksmith services, costing him $100-250 daily as his business doesn't offer these services. Instead of losing money, Luke can sell these leads through our platform to active buyers.

**Buyer:**
Dan operates "ABC Automotive Locksmiths" in Melbourne, also paying for google ads. Dan would like to get 2-3 extra jobs per day, and pay less for advertising. He registers to the platform as a buyer, and sets his details for receiving automotive locksmith jobs within 25 km of Melbourne CBD.

**Exchange:**
When Luke gets a call for automotive services, he sends the lead details to the platform's WhatsApp chat or online form. The system finds a match between Luke and Dan, based on location, service required and availability. Within 5 seconds, Dan receives the lead on WhatsApp, Luke gets paid instantly, and both businesses benefit.


# How does real-time lead exchange work?

**Matching Buyers and Sellers**

Buyers and sellers are matched based on specific criteria, ensuring efficient and real-time connections. Here's a breakdown of each matching criteria:

1. **Region:** This refers to the geographical area where the lead is located, allowing for targeted matching within a specific region. Usually a big city.
2. **Service Required:** This indicates the type of service needed, ensuring that the lead is relevant to the buyer's expertise.
3. **Buyer Schedule:** This denotes the availability or preferred timing of the buyer, ensuring that the lead can be promptly handled.
4. **Job Radius:** This represents the distance or radius within which the buyer can accept leads, optimizing efficiency and logistics.

[flat-design-reseller-illustration_23-2149484586.avif](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/695e28c1-b6c1-4d04-9026-daab376c7136/d23f9d3d-9df5-40f5-a0a1-a5d4470cf758/flat-design-reseller-illustration_23-2149484586.avif)

Similar to the way Uber matches drivers with passengers based on location and destination preferences, our system operates in real-time to match buyers and sellers of leads.

**Matching Process:**

1. **Verification:** When a seller is ready to sell a lead, our system first verifies the presence of an active buyer who can receive the lead immediately. This verification is based on the region, service category, and buyer schedule.
2. **Lead Submission:** The seller then inputs the lead details into the system.
3. **Matching Criteria:** Our system checks the job radius and job description against the buyer's requirements.
4. **Successful Match:** If the criteria align, the lead is successfully matched and sold to the buyer, ensuring a seamless and efficient transaction process.


# Lead pricing guide: determining selling and buying prices

**The cost of leads is determined by several key factors:**

1. **Industry:** Different industries have varying lead costs based on demand and competition levels.
2. **Location:** Lead costs can vary significantly depending on the geographical area due to market dynamics.
3. **Average Job Revenue:** The potential revenue generated from a lead influences its cost.
4. **Quality of Lead:** Leads with higher conversion potential or specific attributes may command a higher price.
5. **Advertising Cost for Industry in That Location:** The cost of advertising within a specific industry and location impacts lead pricing.

A reliable benchmark for lead cost is the average Cost Per Click (CPC) in Google Ads for that industry and region. Leads on our platform are typically 20-30% cheaper than Google Ads or Facebook Ads. For instance, if an automotive locksmith lead costs $40 on Google Ads in Melbourne, it would be priced around $30 on our platform.

Lead costs are higher in locations with more competitive and expensive advertising landscapes. This reflects the expenses incurred by sellers in running paid ads or the value of organic traffic they receive.

**Here are some of the rates for automotive locksmith leads by location in Australia (may be subject to change at time of reading):**

| Location | Lead price (AUD) |
| --- | --- |
| Melbourne | 32$  |
| Sydney | 35$ |
| Brisbane | 30$ |
| Perth | 28$ |
| Adelaide | 28$ |
| Gold - coast | 26$ |


# Is it free to sign up and use the platform?

**Absolutely!** Signing up and using our platform is completely free. The only charges incurred are for purchasing leads


# Selling leads: commission charges explained

When you sell leads through our platform, a commission of 17.5% is applied, which includes processing fees. This commission covers the operational costs of maintaining and improving our platform, ensuring a seamless experience for both sellers and buyers.

**Example:**

Let's say you sell a lead for $100 through our platform. The commission of 17.5% would be applied, resulting in a deduction of $17.50. Therefore, you would receive $82.50 ($100 - $17.50) from the sale of that lead.

# What is a valid lead?

- Is in the service area of the buyer (within location bounds).
- Correct contact details (name and phone).
- Accurate job / service description.
- You have not referred the lead to other people (other than this marketplace).
- The lead / customer has reached out directly to your business through organic or paid channels.
- If the lead has reached out to you on the phone - inform them that you will refer them to a business that can help them.
- You have received this lead within the last 24 hours.

**Valid lead for automotive locksmiths**

- Lead has been received within the past 30 minutes. Automotive locksmith clients typically contact a number of businesses within a short period of time - therefore the lead has low value if delivered too late.
- Lead is related to automotive services - mainly lockouts, car key and ignition jobs.


# When is a lead eligible for refund? (invalid lead)

- Location of customer is out of bounds of buyer.
- Incorrect information in one of these fields - name, phone, address, service description.
- Lead is uncontactable / phone disconnected. Definition of uncontactable - phone goes straight to voice mail or doesn't answer the phone on distinct 3 tries with at least 1 hour apart. For example - if a buyer received a lead at 11:55 pm, called at 12:00, 13:00 and 14:00 with no answer - the lead will be deemed invalid.
- Not sent within the right timeframe (for example - automotive locksmith lead sent 2 hours after initial contact).
- Lead has been referred by seller to multiple people (non exclusive lead).


# How refunds work

When a lead can be refunded - 

- Lead is identified and proven as an invalid lead by any of the criteria above, it is eligible for refund.
- Screenshot of texts or call recordings with lead required to verify that lead is invalid.
- Submit an invalid lead refund request 12 hours or less after receiving the lead.
- Lead is uncontactable / phone disconnected - See section above.

When a lead can’t be refunded -

- Lead is relevant but was asking for a quote only.

How the refund works

Simple - if there are valid grounds to refund the lead, it will not be charged and deducted from the next payment bill. 


# How payments work

**Twice a month, on the first and the fifteenth.**

Sellers will receive their pay and buyers will be charged. 

Right now we are in beta, so the payments are not automated and will be sent manually through bank transfers. 

In future updates this process will be automated via stripe payments.
